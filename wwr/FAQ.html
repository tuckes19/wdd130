            <p>Q. Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</p>
        </section>
        <section class="abox1">
            <p>A. Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found 
            however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall 
            (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). 
            A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck 
            on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of 
            any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the 
            world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention 
            the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with 
            a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all 
            without telling stories… some of which are even true!</p>

            <p>Q. Is whitewater rafting safe? I don’t even know how to swim! Can I still come?</p>
        </section>
        <section class="abox2">
            <p>A. As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. 
                To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid 
                and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries 
                are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips 
                wears coast guard approved life vests or a personal flotation device (PFD). Many 
                non-swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an 
                in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins, explaining what you should 
            prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

        <section class="qbox3">
            <p>Q. What is included in the trip?</p>
        </section>
        <section class="abox3">
            <p>A. We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, 
                foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, 
                eating utensils and camping chair.
                We provide water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate 
                are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor 
                and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these 
                items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 
                Three meals per day, plus snacks.
