                <h2>Beginnings</h2> 
                <h3>Arena Football was created by former NFL and USFL executive Jim Foster, back in 1986. 
                    Foster came up with the idea for arena football while attending an indoor soccer game at Madison Square 
                    Garden in New York City in 1981, and wrote down his ideas for arena football on an envelope, coming up 
                    with the dimensions and basic rules while at the game. Over the course of a few years, he organized and 
                    prepared for the first few test games, setting up sponsors and tv deals with the connections he had from 
                    being an NFL and USFL executive. In 1987, the first official arena football game took place in the four-team 
                    "Arena Football League." </h3> 
                <h2>Differences</h2> 
                <h3>Arena and Standard American Football The glaringly obvious 
                    difference between arena football and your your typical standard American football 
                    (referred to as "standard game") is the size of the field. Arena football is played on the same dimensions of 
                    your standard ice hockey rink, with the field of play being a total of 66 yards long (50 scrimmage yards and 8 
                    yard endzones on either side) and 28 yards wide. Compared to the standard game having a field length of 120 yards 
                    long (100 scrimmage yards and 10 yard endzones) and 49 yards wide. Other major differences include the use of 
                    only 8 players per team in arena football compared to 11 players per team in the standard game. Scores are 
                    typically much higher in arena football, and there is a heavier emphasis on passing and less on running. Most 
                    modern arena football leagues also include a rule where a player on offense may be in motion prior to the ball 
                    being snapped, where in the standard game everybody on offense must be set and still for at least a second before 
                    the ball is snapped.</h3>
