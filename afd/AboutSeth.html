        <h3 class="about-seth">Seth Tucker's love for arena football began back in March of 2018, when he saw a 
            billboard for a new team that was coming to his hometown of Greensboro, NC. In the few weeks 
            leading up to the inaugural game, Seth learned what he could about arena football and was 
            excited for the first game of this new team, the Carolina Cobras. Seth, along with several 
            friends, went to that first game and fell in love with the sport, despite the Cobras falling 
            short to the reigning champions. There was work to be done and help needed for the team though, 
            as evidenced by the lackluster game-program, social media presence, and game attendance. 
            Wanting to help, Seth reached out and met with the front office of the team and struck an internship 
            with them, becoming the lead writer for the team. Below are links to some of Seth's work with the 
            Cobras, which include game previews, post-game recaps, and player signing articles. Seth currently 
            attends BYU-Idaho to continue his schooling career. In his free-time, he still tries to help out 
            the Cobras as he can, making their game highlight videos for their Youtube channel.</h3>
