      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about great American sports. What comes to your mind? I bet one of the sports that did NOT come to your mind was arena football! One of my favorite sports is arena football, and I want more people to learn about it and ultimately become fans of it. I've been an intern for an arena football team and have been studying the sport's history for the past few years now, and I would like to make some of that knowledge known, and in one central location. That's why I think it would be a great idea to build a website that would provide lots of easily accessible information for people to learn about arena football.</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People interested in standard American football that may be looking to get to know more about this twist on the typical game. People that want to learn more about arena football and the sport in general. Arena football veterans may also get a kick out of checking out the site and may learn something new about a team or league. Potential arena football beat writers may also come to the site and see if they can find information about teams to add the info to their articles.</p>
