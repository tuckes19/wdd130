      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about great American sports. What comes to your mind? I bet one of the sports that did NOT come to your mind was arena football! One of my favorite sports is arena football, and I want more people to learn about it and ultimately become fans of it. I've been an intern for an arena football team and have been studying the sport's history for the past few years now, and I would like to make some of that knowledge known, and in one central location. That's why I think it would be a great idea to build a website that would provide lots of easily accessible information for people to learn about arena football.</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People interested in standard American football that may be looking to get to know more about this twist on the typical game. People that want to learn more about arena football and the sport in general. Arena football veterans may also get a kick out of checking out the site and may learn something new about a team or league. Potential arena football beat writers may also come to the site and see if they can find information about teams to add the info to their articles.</p>

      <h3>Arena Football 101</h3>
      <p>
        Beginnings 
        Arena Football was created by former NFL and USFL executive Jim Foster, back in 1986. Foster came up with the idea for arena
football while attending an indoor soccer game at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1981, and wrote down his ideas for arena 
football on an envelope, coming up with the dimensions and basic rules while at the game. Over the course of a few years, he organized 
and prepared for the first few test games, setting up sponsors and tv deals with the connections he had from being an NFL and USFL 
executive. In 1987, the first official arena football game took place in the four-team "Arena Football League."
        Differences Between Arena and Standard American Football
        The glaringly obvious difference between arena football and your your typical standard American football (referred to as
"standard game") is the size of the field. Arena football is played on the same dimensions of your standard ice hockey rink, with the 
field of play being a total of 66 yards long (50 scrimmage yards and 8 yard endzones on either side) and 28 yards wide. Compared to 
the standard game having a field length of 120 yards long (100 scrimmage yards and 10 yard endzones) and 49 yards wide.
        Other major differences include the use of only 8 players per team in arena football compared to 11 players per team in the
standard game. Scores are typically much higher in arena football, and there is a heavier emphasis on passing and less on running.
Most modern arena football leagues also include a rule where a player on offense may be in motion prior to the ball being snapped,
where in the standard game everybody on offense must be set and still for at least a second before the ball is snapped.

      <h3>About Seth Tucker</h3>
      <p>
        Seth Tucker's love for arena football began back in March of 2018, when he saw a billboard for a new team that was coming to
his hometown of Greensboro, NC. In the few weeks leading up to the inaugural game, Seth learned what he could about arena football 
and was excited for the first game of this new team, the Carolina Cobras. Seth, along with several friends, went to that first game and 
fell in love with the sport, despite the Cobras falling short to the reigning champions. There was work to be done and help needed for
the team though, as evidenced by the lackluster game-program, social media presence, and game attendance. Wanting to help, Seth reached
out and met with the front office of the team and struck an internship with them, becoming the lead writer for the team. Below are links
to some of Seth's work with the Cobras, which include game previews, post-game recaps, and player signing articles. 
        Seth currently attends BYU-Idaho to continue his schooling career. In his free-time, he still tries to help out the Cobras
as he can, making their game highlight videos for their Youtube channel.
